# UFO 50 Mod - Campanella 2 Map UI improvements
Makes a couple small adjustments to Campanella 2's UI so you don't have to remember things.

## Features

**Shows location of next scroll on level select map**

If you get a scroll from a sage, the sage will tell you which level to go to next if you want to try for the cherry. But it's easy to forget this information between when you receive the scroll and when you get back to level select.

With the mod installed, a scroll will now appear on top of the appropriate level on the map so you don't lose a cherry run just because you forgot what the sage said.

Note: if you don't collect a scroll, then no scroll will show on the next map screen. 

**Displays what level you are currently in on HUD**

Normally, the name and number of what level you are in just displays on screen for a few seconds at the start of a level.

With the mod installed, an abbreviation of the current level is permanently displayed in the HUD on the right side of the screen.
